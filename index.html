    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>I thrive on maximising business value from data assets.</p>
    
    <p>Data is prolific across all business sectors. Every business will operate many applications and projects to manage and maximise value of this growing asset. Whatever the project, your business need or the size of your data repository, I am confident that I can add value to your technical or business teams delivering or utilising your data.</p>
    
    <h2>Profile</h2>
    
    <p>I specialise in analysing and understanding business processes from a data perspective and translating this into data solutions.</p>
    
    <p>Over 25 years I have been delivering solutions where data integrity and quality has been paramount in producing consistently accurate results. My experience of data lifecycle processes has evolved through iteration of standards and practices as data volumes rapidly increased and technology adapted to cope, giving me a deep insight and understanding of what is now Data Management.</p>
    
    <p>I have a hands-on approach to understanding and delivering data. My technical development background and specialisation in business focussed data exploitation, has fostered a style that enables me to work and communicate with all business and technical teams, as well as customers and suppliers. This is particularly valuable in conflict resolution and aligning expectations to capabilities, and vice versa.</p>
    
    <p>I have successfully used canonical data modelling techniques to influence strategy and direction at project, product, and function levels. I also use these methods to great effect in identifying data relationships and flows for internal operations, external partners, customers and business planning.</p>
    
    <p>I have had roles across all data management disciplines and am comfortable supporting analytical, development or operational functions within technical or business teams. I am as happy writing a SQL statement as I am a business requirement or use case. I will be delighted to attend an interview to elaborate on my experience and to discuss your contract, permanent or fractional data role.</p>
    
    <h3>Business Intelligence</h3>
    
    <p>I have experience of both delivering decision support output to meet information needs and implementing and administering business intelligence delivery platforms.</p>
    
    <h3>Data Warehouse</h3>
    
    <p>I have designed and built multi-sourced integrated data warehouse solutions, with roles covering the full development lifecycle, as both a team lead and as a team member.</p>
    
    <h3>Data Governance</h3>
    
    <p>I have defined and implemented governance policies and frameworks in highly regulated industries and have mastered reference data and monitored data quality as data steward.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h2>Skills</h2>
    
    <p>I have been working in Systems and IT departments since the early days of PC's and networking. As a result, I have picked up an understanding of using computers and software tools that enables me to operate in most environments and to pick up new skills quickly.</p>
    
    <p>Whilst I would not class myself as a Developer with current coding skills, I have been a developer with coding skills in application development and in Data Warehouse ETL. It would not take me long to plug back in to coding in a Data Warehouse environment and my BA roles have all ended up with elements of coding. The [Experience](experience) section highlights my adaptation where applicable.</p>
    
    <p>It is difficult to define a list of hard skills when there are so many tools and platforms to use. I, personally, would not class myself as _expert_ in any tool or platform but am often informed by clients that they consider me an expert!</p>
    
    <p>To provide some usable estimation for this site, I have tried not to define hard skills by how I judge them: as a percentage of my knowledge of the entire platform or tool; but instead as a percentage of my ability to use the platform or tool productively in providing results at a client's or employer's site. I hope this helps.</p>
